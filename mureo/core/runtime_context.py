"""``RuntimeContext`` — frozen aggregate of the four core extension Protocols
plus an opaque workspace identifier, ``default_runtime_context()`` — the
factory that wires the four file-backed defaults, and
``get_runtime_context()`` — the resolver that lets alternate backends
inject a custom context via the ``mureo.runtime_context_factory`` entry
point group.

A ``RuntimeContext`` is the single object passed through mureo call sites
that need pluggable backends for credentials, persisted state, ``/learn``
knowledge, and API throttling. Today nothing in OSS constructs a
``RuntimeContext`` automatically — call sites still talk to the legacy
helpers in ``mureo.auth`` / ``mureo.context`` / ``mureo.mcp`` directly.
Hookup of consumers ships in follow-up commits; this module introduces
the type, the default factory, and the resolver so alternate backends
can be wired before the refactor lands.

``workspace_id`` is intentionally opaque. For single-workspace callers
the canonical value is the literal :data:`DEFAULT_WORKSPACE_ID`;
alternate runtimes are free to use any other non-empty string. Empty
strings are rejected at construction time.

    - **Factory registered, filesystem-backed store** → return the

    - **Factory registered, non-filesystem store** → return ``default``.
